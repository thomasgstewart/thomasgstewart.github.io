I am a statistician because I enjoy tackling the questions of data-driven health research. I pursued a PhD because I love to teach. This is an exciting era in health research; new and better technologies are offering researchers opportunities to collect, explore, and engage biological, social, and economic data as never before. I enjoy collaborating with researchers in this new frontier.
